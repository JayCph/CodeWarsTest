A small C# NUnit testing setup for https://www.codewars.com/

HOW TO:
	(1) Place your [TestFixture] TestClass.cs. The [TestFixture] is to be found in each task on codewars.com
	(2) Add a class, name it appropriately, in the corresponding kyu-folder (just for organizational purposes)
	(3) Write your solution to the problem given
	(4) Right click TestClass.cs and hit 'Run Tests'
	(5) See the Test Explorer to see if you've got the smarts!
	(6) Out comment your completed class when moving on to the next, so there wont be any duplicate method names,
		which will make the TestClass unable to test the correct method.

Happy Coding, Janus
